# Mineralogy-by-K-Means
Using incoming elemental data (as a flat table) and a user-defined library of minerals and mineral chemistry, the code runs a k-means clustering to group chemically similar rows in the incoming table.
Method is per Harraden et al, 2024, in prep. 
Details and step-by-step instructions on how to use the notebook are available in the downloads.
